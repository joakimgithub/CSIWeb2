                <h2>Help us become even better!</h2>
               Our Clients are the most important source for our continued improvement and development. Therefore we ask you to tell us what you consider to be the most important criteria for the success of delivering the engagement. When it is time to follow-up the engagement we will ask you to evaluate to what degree we have met your expectations. This simple routine is an important part of our Quality System. Examples of quality criteria can be:
